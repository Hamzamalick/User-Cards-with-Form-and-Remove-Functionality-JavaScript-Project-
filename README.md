# User Cards with Form and Remove Functionality

This project is built to practice and understand the `this` keyword in JavaScript.  
It creates user cards dynamically from form input and allows each card to be removed individually.

## Features
- Add a new user card by filling the form
- Display user information on the card
- Remove user cards with a dedicated button
- Learn and experiment with the `this` keyword in JavaScript

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works
1. Fill in the form with user details.
2. A new card will be generated with the entered info.
3. Each card has a **Remove User** button. Clicking it will delete that card.
4. The project highlights the use of the `this` keyword in event listeners and card actions.
